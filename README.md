# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

In this project, I use Javascript to create a random password generator. Upon clicking the generate password, the user will be prompted to select from a series of parameters that will be used to generate the password. These parameters are password length, use of numbers, lowercase/uppercase letters, and symbols. After selecting the parameters, the password will be generated and displayed for the user to copy. 

Here is a [screenshot](./Assets/password%20screenshot.jpg) of my application in progress.
